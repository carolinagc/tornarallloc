# Tornar al Lloc - Description

Tornar al Lloc is a project that follows old people from Barceloneta (Barcelona-Spain)
through different spaces that have been important in their lives, a way to explore the memory
of a neighborhood through the memory of their people.

We are going to map those memories by using a thinking tool that can hold the complexity of a long term
and visualize them on a map, so that we can be aware of where they have taken place.
